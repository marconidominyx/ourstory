							</p>

								Later, we called. At first the internet failed, but we tried

								me to rest.

								That night, the rain fell heavy. You were at your apartment, I

							<p class="timeline-description">

							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								We called anyway, while both of us did our own things — me
								brushing my teeth and reading Tales of Demons and Gods, you
								writing in your notes. It wasn't about the activity; it was
								about presence.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								That night, you let me into a deeper part of yourself — your

								listened. And you thanked me for it.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								The next morning, I woke up smiling. Another peaceful sleep,

								to go through my night routine before bed, to take it easy when

								from workouts. We became each other's balance.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								Even on busy days — when you had conventions, or when I was

								"God bless you" carried so much more weight than the words
								themselves.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								Then there were the late-night calls. Hours and hours, even

								we never felt alone anymore.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								That was the magic of those days: It wasn't grand gestures or

								In the beginning, our conversations were simple. Short messages,
								often ending with periods and no hint of emotion. At first, it
								puzzled me. I wondered if you were distant, or if maybe I was
								overthinking. But soon, I came to understand something deeper
								about you: typing was never really your thing.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								You preferred calls. You loved hearing voices, the warmth, the
								presence it carried. And honestly, calls weren't something I
								ever liked doing. I always thought they were awkward, tiring,
								and not for me. But then came you.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								With you, the calls didn't feel heavy. They felt natural. Even
								the silences had meaning. There was no pressure to perform, no
								need to fill every gap with words. Just knowing you were on the
								other side — breathing, listening, staying — made me feel at
								peace.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								Every night, as we grew closer, those calls became our little
								sanctuary. They weren't perfect. Sometimes I was busy with
								homework or projects. Sometimes you were tired from your day.
								But still, we showed up. We let our voices bridge the distance.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								And slowly, I realized something beautiful:<br />
								It wasn't that I didn't like calls.<br />
								It was that I hadn't found the right person to call with.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								With you, Eli, I found comfort in something I once disliked.
								Your voice became my favorite sound, a place where my restless
								mind could rest. It wasn't about what we said — it was about who
								I was saying it with.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								That was the moment I knew: if even silence with you felt this

								don't mind." And just like that, silence wasn't lonely anymore —

								enough, even in your quirks.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								Even the smallest things became our inside jokes. Your
								ink-stained hands, clumsy notes, and my constant reminders not
								to skip breakfast or drink too much coffee. You'd roll your
								eyes, I'd pretend to nag — but underneath it all, we both knew
								it was love dressed as laughter.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								There were moments of shy giggles too, when you'd admit
								something and then cover it up with emojis or playful excuses.
								Moments when I'd tease you to step out of your comfort zone, and
								you'd fight back with sass, only to soften in the end.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								We were serious when it mattered, but more often we were just us
								— playful, silly, lighthearted. And in those moments, I realized
								something: It wasn't just that I loved you. It was that I loved
								the way we loved — a love that could be tender in the night,
								steady in the gloom, and joyful in the everyday.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">

							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								You weren't just a voice on the other line anymore, Eli. You
								became my peace, my safe harbor. Those nightly routine calls,

								needed. For someone like me who struggles with overthinking, you
								gave me assurance that calmed the noise inside my head.

							<p class="timeline-description">
								Our first month wasn't about grand gestures—it was about

								together.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								I wrote to you then: "I can hardly believe it's been a whole

							</p>

							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								By our second monthsary, something in me had shifted. In the

								every day reminded me that you weren't just my girlfriend. You
								had become my best friend, my safe place, my light.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								I wrote to you then: "Tomorrow marks 61 incredible days since we
								began this journey together, and every single one of them has
								reminded me just how lucky I am to have you — not just as my
								girlfriend, but as my best friend. You're my safe place, my
								light, and my greatest blessing."
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								Those words were the truest I had ever written. With you, I
								could speak honestly. I could show the parts of me I once tried
								to hide — the fears, the overthinking, the brokenness. And
								instead of turning away, you stayed. You saw all of me and
								called me yours anyway.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								We had both been through so much. We knew the weight of hidden
								bruises, the quiet battles no one else could see. But together,
								we found beauty in them. Together, we learned that even broken
								pieces could create something whole.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">

								my happiness and success with, no matter how far apart we may
								be."
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								By then, love wasn't just a feeling. It was a decision. A
								commitment. A daily choice to stay, to build, and to believe in

								doubt — you were not just someone I loved. You were my queen, my
								anchor, my home.

								By the fifth month, life grew even busier. School, work, and
								responsibilities pulled us in different directions. Yet, even
								when words were fewer, our longing for each other proved that
								distance could not shake what we had. We reminded ourselves of
								the future we were building—that patience and faith would carry

								to prepare, to one day turn all of this into a forever built
								side by side.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								The sixth month brought a deeper realization: what we had was a
								gift from God. Our love wasn't random—it was woven into His
								plan. Each day became a testimony of His grace, proof that He
								answers prayers in His perfect time.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								By the seventh month, we began to see how much we had grown—not
								just as individuals but as a couple. Loving each other taught us
								how to love ourselves better, how to be healthier, stronger, and
								more faithful. We began to dream more boldly: of building a
								home, raising a family, and becoming a living testimony of love
								anchored in God.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">
								And now, in the eighth month, we look back in awe. Eight months
								of choosing each other. Eight months of growing, stumbling,

								meeting in person yet. How beautiful, how rare, how special this
								journey has been.
							</p>
							<p class="timeline-description">

						Our story is a flame that will never fade,<br />
						A vow in the night, a promise we've made.<br />
						Through distance, through time, through all that we do,<br />
						Every page of my life—I'll write it with you.
